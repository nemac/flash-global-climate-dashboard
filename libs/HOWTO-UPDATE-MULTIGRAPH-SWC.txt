To update your copy of the Multigraph swc library to a new one:

    1. In a web browser, browse to:
            http://www3.nemac.unca.edu/newmg
    2. Right-click on the most recent NewMultigraph-*.swc file (if there is more than
       one present), choose "Save Link As", and save the file into your Dashboard
       project's "libs" folder, which will be somewhere like:
            C:\Users\Mark Phillips\Adobe Flash Builder 4\Dashboard\libs
    3. Back in Flash Builder, right-click on the Dashboard project (top-level entry)
       in the Project Explorer, and choose "Refresh" from the menu
    4. Look inside the "libs" folder in the Flash Builder Package Explorer, and
       delete any old NewMultigraph-*.swc files, leaving only the newest one.
    5. Clean the project
